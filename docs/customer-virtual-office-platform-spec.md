# Customer Virtual Office Platform - Global Product and Technical Specification

## 1. Document Purpose

This document defines the global product and technical specification for the
Aedventure Customer Virtual Office Platform.

The platform is a multi-tenant, customizable, 2D virtual office product. It
combines a SkyOffice-derived customer application, a future SaaS Foundation
control plane, meeting-provider integrations, 2D world management, and
AI-friendly APIs.

This document is intentionally broad and detailed. It should be used as the
reference for product planning, architecture decisions, implementation phases,
technical reviews, and future agent-oriented integration work.

## 2. Finalized Project Stance

The project starts with a **hard fork reset** of the Customer Virtual Office
App architecture.

The first engineering step is to preserve SkyOffice under `legacy/`, freeze
feature work, and rebuild the target architecture under `apps/` and
`packages/`. Step 0 is not optional and should not be treated as a small
cleanup pass.

The SaaS Foundation/backoffice is still the intended long-term control plane
for:

- Tenants.
- Organizations.
- Users.
- Roles.
- Permissions.
- Subscriptions.
- Billing metadata.
- Feature flags.
- Audit logs.
- Support access.
- Tenant configuration.
- AI agent governance.

However, the immediate engineering focus is not product features. It is
replacing risky inherited architecture: client-authoritative movement,
password-only auth, PeerJS media, in-memory-only state, and bundled asset risk.

## 3. Core Product Vision

The product is a tenant-customizable virtual office where users can enter a
browser-based 2D world, move as avatars, discover colleagues, join rooms,
launch meetings, interact with objects, attend events, collaborate, and
eventually work alongside AI agents.

The long-term product should become:

> A tenant-customizable spatial work environment where humans and AI agents can
> navigate, meet, collaborate, and automate safely.

The product should feel like a real customer application, not a technical demo.
It should be configurable enough for many tenants to have different worlds,
rules, meeting providers, branding, and agent policies without requiring custom
code per tenant.

## 4. Primary Goals

The platform must eventually allow each tenant to:

1. Create and manage one or more 2D virtual office worlds.
2. Customize maps, floors, rooms, zones, portals, objects, and spawn points.
3. Use the platform LiveKit/coturn media layer for proximity and meeting
   media.
4. Bring their own Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Jitsi later where a
   tenant wants external provider workflows.
5. Assign user access through tenant-aware RBAC.
6. Invite guests safely.
7. Configure branding and tenant-specific settings.
8. Track usage and cost.
9. Publish and roll back world versions.
10. Expose safe, structured APIs for AI agents.
11. Support small pilot tenants first and large tenants later.

## 5. Immediate Build Strategy

### 5.1 Start With A Hard-Fork Reset

SkyOffice is the legacy reference for:

- 2D rendering.
- Avatar movement.
- Phaser-based world interaction.
- Colyseus-based realtime state.
- Basic object interaction.
- Virtual office spatial UX.

The fork should not be treated as the target architecture.

### 5.2 Step 0 Is A Major Refactor

Step 0 exists to make the fork safe enough for product development.

Step 0 goals:

- Preserve SkyOffice history under `legacy/skyoffice-original`.
- Establish target `apps/` and `packages/` structure.
- Make the legacy build reproducible.
- Audit licensing and asset redistribution risk.
- Replace auth with Wikimedia OAuth 2.0 and local sessions.
- Add Postgres persistence.
- Replace client-authoritative movement with server-authoritative movement.
- Replace PeerJS with LiveKit/coturn.
- Define a clean protocol package.
- Rebuild permissions before product features.

Step 0 non-goals:

- No product feature work.
- No admin polish.
- No enterprise meeting-provider integrations.
- No production AI agents.
- No broadcast/event infrastructure.
- No design polish on legacy architecture.

### 5.3 Asset Licensing Is A Step 0 Gate

The target app must not bundle inherited assets unless their redistribution
rights are clear and recorded. SkyOffice assets may remain under `legacy/` only
as temporary reference material while the target app is rebuilt.

Art direction and final production asset replacement can happen later, but the
license boundary cannot be deferred.

For now:

- Existing SkyOffice assets may be kept under `legacy/` for internal reference.
- Assets should be clearly marked as not cleared for commercial launch.
- No early engineering time should be spent replacing all sprites, tilesets,
  or art packs.
- Target app code must not copy or load uncleared legacy assets.
- The project must not publicly launch commercially with uncleared assets.
- Production-safe asset replacement belongs in a later commercial readiness
  phase.

Rationale:

Art replacement is important, but it is not the first technical risk. The first
technical risk is turning the SkyOffice prototype into a maintainable,
configurable, tenant-ready product foundation.

## 6. Product Boundaries

### 6.1 Customer Virtual Office App

The Customer Virtual Office App owns:

- 2D world rendering.
- Avatar movement.
- Presence.
- Realtime room state.
- Object interactions.
- Meeting-zone UX.
- Map loading.
- Spatial navigation.
- User-facing virtual office experience.
- Tenant-specific world presentation.

### 6.2 SaaS Foundation / Backoffice

The SaaS Foundation owns:

- Authentication.
- Tenant management.
- User management.

- Billing metadata.
- Audit.
- Support access.
- Impersonation.
- Feature flags.
- API keys.
- Webhooks.
- Tenant settings.
- Usage governance.

The Virtual Office App should not reimplement these systems. It should consume
them through APIs and tokens.

Initial priority:

1. LiveKit for proximity media and room meetings.
2. coturn for TURN fallback.

## 9. Repository Direction After Fork

The hard fork should use this structure:

```text
legacy/
  skyoffice-original/

apps/
  web/
  world-server/
  api/
  media-gateway/

packages/
  protocol/
  map-engine/
  auth-wikimedia/
  shared-types/

infra/
  docker-compose.yml

docs/
  customer-virtual-office-platform-spec.md
```

`legacy/skyoffice-original/` is reference code. Target app code should be built
under `apps/` and shared packages should be built under `packages/`.

## 10. 2D World Domain Model

The 2D world must be structured data, not just a static game map.

High-level hierarchy:

```text
Tenant
  VirtualWorld
    WorldFloor

- Object interactions.
- Chat events.
- Meeting state changes.
- Moderation events.

Initial likely stack:

- Phaser on the client.

- Redis later for multi-node coordination.
- SaaS Foundation/backend as source of truth.

### 14.1 Ephemeral State

Stored in realtime service:

- Current player positions.
- Movement direction.
- Active players.
- Active room membership.
- Temporary object interaction state.
- Current proximity group.
- Current meeting participant state.

### 14.2 Persistent State

Stored in backend/database:

- Portals.
- Spawn points.
- User profiles.
- Roles.
- Meeting settings.
- Audit logs.
- Usage events.

### 14.3 Realtime Auth

Flow:

1. User authenticates through the platform.
2. Customer app requests a short-lived realtime token.
3. Backend issues token for a tenant/user/world scope.
4. Realtime server validates the token.
5. Realtime server checks join permission.
6. User joins the world.

Token claims:

- `tenant_id`
- `user_id`
- `session_id`
- `world_id`
- `floor_id`
- `roles`
- `permissions`
- `guest`
- `expires_at`
- `nonce`

Step 0 may use mocked auth, but interfaces should be shaped for the final flow.

## 15. Media And Meeting Architecture

### 15.1 Provider Strategy

The product should not keep SkyOffice's PeerJS media layer.

Provider priority:

1. LiveKit for the first product media layer.
2. coturn for TURN fallback.
3. Server-issued LiveKit JWTs.
4. Server-controlled proximity and room media policy.
5. External meeting links for quick compatibility.
6. Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Jitsi for later tenant BYO options.
7. Broadcast mode for large rooms later.

### 15.2 MediaProvider Interface

Platform media abstraction:

```text
MediaProvider
  createRoom(input)
  getRoom(providerRoomId)
  updateRoom(providerRoomId, input)
  closeRoom(providerRoomId)
  createJoinToken(input)
  updateSubscriptionPolicy(input)
  listParticipants(providerRoomId)
  disconnectParticipant(input)
  getRecording(providerRoomId)
  getTranscript(providerRoomId)
  validateWebhook(request)
```

### 15.3 MediaRoom

Fields:

- `id`
- `tenant_id`
- `world_id`
- `zone_id`
- `name`
- `provider`
- `provider_config`
- `media_mode`
- `capacity`
- `moderation_policy`
- `recording_policy`
- `transcription_policy`
- `guest_policy`
- `ai_policy`

Media modes:

- `proximity`
- `instant`
- `scheduled`
- `persistent`
- `external_provider`
- `broadcast`
- `q_and_a`

### 15.4 LiveKit Requirements

The first media provider should support:

- Tenant-scoped room naming.
- JWT-authenticated join.
- Server-issued short-lived tokens.
- Selective subscriptions.
- Proximity-driven subscription changes.
- TURN fallback through coturn.
- Moderator configuration.
- Lobby support if configured.

### 15.6 Broadcast Mode

Broadcast mode is a later phase for large rooms.

Model:

- Presenters join a realtime meeting/stage.

## 20. AI-Friendly Requirements

AI-friendliness must be designed in from the beginning, even if production AI
features ship later.

### 20.1 Principles

AI agents should:

- Use structured APIs.
- Have explicit identity.
- Be permissioned through RBAC.
- Operate within tenant policy.
- Produce audit events.
- Use stable object IDs.
- Use semantic world metadata.
- Avoid scraping the visual UI.

AI agents should not:

- Have hidden superuser access.
- Bypass tenant isolation.
- Read private location data by default.
- Join meetings without policy permission.
- Summarize meetings without explicit tenant approval.
- Modify maps without high-risk permissions.

### 20.2 AgentProfile

Fields:

- `id`
- `tenant_id`
- `name`
- `description`
- `owner_user_id`
- `agent_type`
- `status`
- `permissions`
- `allowed_tools`
- `allowed_worlds`
- `allowed_zones`
- `created_at`
- `last_active_at`

Agent types:

- `personal_assistant`
- `tenant_assistant`
- `meeting_assistant`
- `reception_assistant`
- `map_assistant`
- `support_assistant`
- `automation_agent`

### 20.3 Semantic World API

Future endpoints:

```http
GET /api/virtual-office/worlds
GET /api/virtual-office/worlds/{world_id}
GET /api/virtual-office/worlds/{world_id}/semantic-map
GET /api/virtual-office/worlds/{world_id}/rooms
GET /api/virtual-office/worlds/{world_id}/objects
GET /api/virtual-office/worlds/{world_id}/zones
GET /api/virtual-office/worlds/{world_id}/navigation-graph
```

Semantic map response should include:

- Rooms.
- Zones.
- Portals.
- Objects.
- Interaction points.
- Access rules.
- Descriptions.
- Coordinates.
- Agent-readable labels.
- Navigation paths.

### 20.4 Agent Action API

Future endpoints:

```http
POST /api/agent-actions/navigate
POST /api/agent-actions/send-message
POST /api/agent-actions/schedule-meeting
POST /api/agent-actions/create-room-reservation
POST /api/agent-actions/find-user
POST /api/agent-actions/summarize-space
POST /api/agent-actions/trigger-workflow
```

Each action should record:

- Actor.
- Tenant.
- User or agent identity.
- Permission check.
- Input payload.
- Output payload.
- Timestamp.
- Request ID.
- Audit event.
- Result.

### 20.5 AI Tool Manifest

The platform should expose machine-readable tool manifests later.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "virtual_office",
  "capabilities": [
    "list_worlds",
    "read_semantic_map",
    "schedule_meeting",
    "send_room_message",
    "find_available_room"
  ],
  "auth": "platform_token",
  "permission_model": "rbac",
  "audit": "required"
}
```

## 21. API Requirements

API style:

- REST initially.
- WebSocket/realtime for movement.
- Webhooks for meeting providers.
- Agent-specific APIs later.
- OpenAPI documentation.
- Stable IDs.
- Idempotency keys for mutations.
- Request IDs.
- Tenant context.

Initial future endpoint family:

```http
GET /api/virtual-office/worlds
POST /api/virtual-office/worlds
GET /api/virtual-office/worlds/{id}
PATCH /api/virtual-office/worlds/{id}
DELETE /api/virtual-office/worlds/{id}

GET /api/virtual-office/worlds/{id}/maps
POST /api/virtual-office/worlds/{id}/maps
POST /api/virtual-office/maps/{id}/publish
POST /api/virtual-office/maps/{id}/validate

GET /api/virtual-office/maps/{id}/semantic
GET /api/virtual-office/maps/{id}/navigation-graph

GET /api/virtual-office/meeting-rooms
POST /api/virtual-office/meeting-rooms
POST /api/virtual-office/meeting-rooms/{id}/join

POST /api/virtual-office/realtime-token
POST /api/virtual-office/guest-pass

POST /api/virtual-office/agents/{id}/actions
```

## 22. Realtime Protocol

Client events:

- `player.move`
- `player.stop`
- `player.interact`
- `player.enter_zone`
- `player.leave_zone`
- `chat.send`
- `meeting.join_request`
- `meeting.leave`

Server events:

- `world.state`
- `player.joined`
- `player.left`
- `player.moved`
- `presence.updated`
- `zone.entered`
- `zone.left`
- `object.updated`
- `meeting.started`
- `meeting.ended`
- `chat.message`
- `moderation.event`

## 23. Usage Metering

Usage should be measured from early phases.

Metrics:

- Registered users.
- Monthly active users.
- Peak concurrent users.
- Realtime connection minutes.
- Meeting join events.
- Hosted LiveKit/SFU minutes.
- TURN relay GB.

## 24. Cost Model

The platform should separate costs into:

- Shared infra.
- Per-tenant fixed cost.
- Per-user variable cost.
- Usage-metered media cost.
- Usage-metered AI cost.

Initial target cost model:

```text
tenant_cogs =
  allocated_shared_infra
  + tenant_fixed
  + registered_users * user_base_cost
  + active_users * realtime_cost
  + broadcast_minutes_delivered * broadcast_rate
  + recording_minutes_stored * storage_rate
  + turn_relay_gb * relay_bandwidth_cost
  + dedicated_media_nodes
  + ai_actions * ai_action_rate
```

Media should not be unlimited by default.

Meter or cap:

- Broadcast viewer-minutes.
- Recording storage.
- Hosted LiveKit/SFU minutes.
- TURN relay traffic.
- Transcription.
- AI summaries.
- Long audit/log retention.

## 25. Security Requirements

Security baseline:

- Tenant isolation.

- Guest data expiry.
- Recording retention.
- Audit retention policies.

## 27. Observability

Track:

- API latency.
- Realtime connection count.

- AI action volume.
- Permission denied events.
- Tenant usage spikes.

Dashboards:

- Platform health.
- Tenant health.
- Media usage.
- Realtime usage.

- Tenant-custom map editor.

## 30. Phase Plan

### Phase 0: Hard-Fork Reset

Purpose:

Stop building on the risky SkyOffice architecture and create a clean product
foundation before feature work resumes.

Stack orientation:

- The product codebase should be TypeScript-first across protocol, policy, API,
  world-server, client, and tests.
- The infrastructure should remain best-fit rather than TypeScript-only:
  Postgres for durable state, Valkey for ephemeral coordination, LiveKit/coturn
  for realtime media, S3-compatible storage/CDN for assets, and Tauri 2 only as
  a later desktop packaging wrapper.
- Phaser 4 is the preferred browser world renderer. `TilemapGPULayer` should be
  evaluated for orthographic static layers, but the map engine must still model
  semantic maps, zones, permissions, portals, and navigation independently of
  any one renderer.

Deliverables:

- SkyOffice preserved under `legacy/skyoffice-original`.
- Target `apps/` and `packages/` structure.
- Reproducible legacy build check.
- License audit and asset manifest.
- Feature freeze.
- Wikimedia OAuth 2.0 login.
- Local user, identity, and session model.
- PostgreSQL schema for durable product state.
- Server-authoritative movement protocol.
- Server-side collision, speed, zone, proximity, and transition checks.
- Server-filtered chat delivery rules.
- LiveKit/coturn media replacement plan and first server-issued token flow.
- Clean protocol package.
- Permission model rebuilt around roles, rooms, and zones.
- Docker Compose plan for full-stack boot.

Acceptance criteria:

- Build is reproducible.
- Tests or verification commands run in CI.
- No non-open assets are bundled in the target app.
- Wikimedia OAuth login works.
- Postgres user/session model exists.
- Client no longer sends authoritative `x/y`.
- Server validates movement.
- Chat delivery is server-filtered.
- LiveKit migration plan is committed.
- Docker Compose boots the full stack.

### Phase 1: Customer Virtual Office App MVP

Purpose:

Build the first product-shaped customer app after Phase 0 gates pass.

Deliverables:

- Tenant-shaped app shell.
- Basic world loading.
- Avatar movement.
- Presence.
- Object interactions.
- LiveKit meeting/proximity zone prototype.
- Config-driven office layout.
- Basic room and zone permissions.
- Basic server-side chat modes.
- Browser-first client using Phaser 4 and TypeScript.
- Simple in-world UI overlays using vanilla HTML/TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
  where useful.

Explicitly deferred:

- Tauri desktop packaging.
- Full SaaS/admin backoffice UI framework decision.
- Large-room broadcast UX beyond core media policy.

### Phase 2: SaaS Foundation Connection

Purpose:

Connect the app to the SaaS control plane.

Deliverables:

- Authenticated access through SaaS Foundation.
- Realtime token issuance.
- User identity bridge.
- Tenant/world ownership model.
- Basic RBAC checks for entering worlds and rooms.

### Phase 3: World Persistence

Purpose:

Replace prototype state with persistent tenant-scoped world state.

Deliverables:

- Backend models for worlds, maps, zones, objects, spawn points.
- World/map/object APIs.
- Save/load world config from backend.
- Basic admin API.
- Remaining hard-coded SkyOffice state removed or isolated.

### Phase 4: Tenant Customization

Purpose:

Allow each tenant to configure its own workspace.

Deliverables:

- Tenant-specific worlds.
- Tenant branding.
- Configurable media policy.
- Later BYO meeting provider settings.
- Room permissions.
- Guest access.
- Usage limits.

### Phase 5: World Management UI

Purpose:

Give tenant admins practical world management controls.

Deliverables:

- World list.
- World detail.
- Basic map/object/zone management.
- Publish/rollback flow.
- Validation checks.

### Phase 6: AI-Friendly APIs

Purpose:

Make the platform usable by AI agents without UI scraping.

Deliverables:

- Semantic map endpoint.
- Agent-readable rooms/zones/objects.
- Agent action API.
- Agent permission model.
- Full audit logging for agent actions.
- Tool manifest.

### Phase 7: Enterprise Meeting Integrations

Purpose:

Support tenants that already use enterprise meeting platforms.

Deliverables:

- Google Meet integration.
- Microsoft Teams integration.
- Zoom integration.
- Tenant BYO meeting provider settings.

### Phase 8: Broadcast / Large Room Mode

Purpose:

Support town halls and large events efficiently.

Deliverables:

- Presenter stage.
- Broadcast viewer mode.
- Moderated Q&A promotion.
- Broadcast usage metering.

### Phase 9: Commercial Asset And Licensing Cleanup

Purpose:

Prepare for public commercial launch.

Deliverables:

- Replace or license production assets.
- Commercial-safe default tilesets.
- Commercial-safe default avatar sprites.
- Tenant asset library.
- Asset license metadata.
- Public launch art pack.

Final art direction and a public launch art pack can happen much later than
Step 0. The license quarantine itself is a Step 0 requirement.

## 31. MVP Scope

The first MVP should include:

- Refactored SkyOffice fork.
- Basic customer app route.
- Basic world loading.
- Avatar movement.
- Presence.
- Data-driven object config.
- LiveKit meeting/proximity zone concept.
- Wikimedia-authenticated user/session flow.
- Basic realtime/world token abstraction.
- Server-authoritative movement.
- Server-filtered chat.
- Basic usage events.
- Basic semantic map shape.

The first MVP should not include:

- Full SaaS billing.
- Full map editor.
- Final production art pack replacement.
- Google/Teams/Zoom integrations.
- Broadcast events.
- Production AI agents.
- Full enterprise compliance.

## 32. Risk Register

### 32.1 SkyOffice Prototype Risk

Risk:

The original SkyOffice code may have hard-coded assumptions that slow product
development.

Mitigation:

Step 0 major refactor before feature expansion.

### 32.2 Realtime Scaling Risk

Risk:

Realtime presence and movement may become expensive or unstable at high
concurrency.

Mitigation:

Start small, measure early, keep persistent state outside the realtime server,
and plan Redis/multi-node support.

### 32.3 Meeting Complexity Risk

Risk:

Native audio/video can become a large infrastructure burden.

Mitigation:

Use LiveKit/coturn with server-issued tokens first, keep media policy
server-controlled, and offer BYO Google/Teams/Zoom/Jitsi later.

### 32.4 Map Editor Scope Risk

Risk:

A full visual editor can become its own product.

Mitigation:

Start with import/config/admin workflows before building a full drag-and-drop
editor.

### 32.5 Asset Licensing Risk

Risk:

Development assets may not be safe for commercial launch.

Mitigation:

Quarantine inherited assets under `legacy/`, do not copy them into the target
app, and require a manifest entry before any target-app asset is bundled.

### 32.6 AI Safety Risk

Risk:

Agents could access sensitive user, room, or meeting data.

Mitigation:

Design agent APIs around RBAC, explicit scopes, audit events, and tenant
approval.

## 33. Definition Of Done For Full Product

The full product is complete when:

- Tenants can manage users, roles, and permissions through the control plane.
- Tenants can create and customize worlds.
- Tenants can manage maps, rooms, objects, zones, and spawn points.
- Users can enter the 2D office reliably.
- Users can join meetings through configured providers.
- Guests can be invited safely.
- Large events can use broadcast mode.
- AI agents can inspect and act through structured APIs.
- AI actions are permissioned and audited.
- Platform admins can monitor usage and cost.
- Tenant admins can configure branding and policies.
- The system supports per-tenant customization without code changes.
- The system can scale from small pilots to large tenants.
- Media costs are metered or capped.
- Security and audit requirements are met.
- Commercial assets are cleared before public launch.

## 34. Strategic Summary

The correct starting point is not the full SaaS platform. The correct starting
point is the **Customer Virtual Office App**.

The first step is not adding features. The first step is the **SkyOffice fork
and major refactor**.

After that, the product can progressively connect to the SaaS Foundation,
support tenant-custom worlds, add external meeting-provider integrations, add
world management, expose AI-friendly APIs, and eventually support broadcast
events.

The long-term product is not just a 2D office. It is a configurable spatial
work platform that tenants can shape and that AI agents can understand safely.
