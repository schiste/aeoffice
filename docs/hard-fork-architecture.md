# Hard-Fork Target Architecture

## 1. Target Runtime

The target architecture is a Unified TypeScript Product Layer over best-fit
infrastructure services. TypeScript should own product logic, protocol
contracts, policy decisions, and UI composition. It should not force
infrastructure choices where dedicated systems are better: LiveKit remains
Go-based media infrastructure, Postgres remains SQL durable state, and Tauri
uses Rust for a later desktop wrapper.

## 1.1 Client Rendering Strategy

The default web client should be Phaser 4 plus TypeScript.

Rendering targets:

- Orthographic office maps should prefer Phaser 4 `TilemapGPULayer` when a map
  layer uses one tileset, does not need frequent tile mutation, and fits the GPU
  layer restrictions.
- Isometric, hexagonal, highly dynamic, or multi-tileset layers should fall back
  to normal Phaser tilemap rendering or a custom renderer after profiling.
- UI overlays should start as vanilla HTML/TypeScript with Tailwind CSS v4 where
  it keeps code readable. Complex backoffice surfaces may still use React or
  Svelte if the SaaS Foundation or admin UI benefits from components, routing,
  and richer state management.

Client-side Phaser can predict movement and detect local proximity for user
experience. It must not grant room, zone, chat, or media access. Those decisions
remain server-side.

## 2. Movement Protocol

Client sends intent:

```json
{
  "type": "move",
  "direction": "down",
  "seq": 42
}
```

Server computes:

- New position.
- Collision.
- Speed limit.
- Zone permission.
- Proximity membership.
- Room transition.

Server broadcasts state:

```json
{
  "type": "player_state",
  "playerId": "p_123",
  "x": 705,
  "y": 508,
  "anim": "adam_walk_down",
  "seqAck": 42
}
```

## 3. Auth Boundary

Wikimedia OAuth establishes external identity.

Local API creates:

- User.
- OAuth identity.
- Session.
- Roles.
- Permissions.

World server trusts only API-issued session/world tokens, never raw client
claims.

## 4. Media Boundary

The target app uses LiveKit for media.

Flow:

1. Client reports movement intent to the world server.
2. World server computes position, proximity, and zone membership.
3. World server/API decides media permission.
4. Media gateway creates a server-issued LiveKit JWT.
5. Client connects to LiveKit with that token.
6. Server policy controls which rooms/zones produce media access.

Phaser may trigger the user experience around proximity, but LiveKit access is
never opened by Phaser alone.

## 5. Persistence Boundary

Postgres owns durable state.

Colyseus owns live state only.

Valkey/Redis supports:

- Sessions/cache where appropriate.
- Pub/sub or adapters.
- Rate limits.
- Short-lived coordination.

## 6. Permission Boundary

Permissions are server-side.

The client may hide UI, but server checks decide:

- Enter room.
- Enter zone.
- Send chat.
- Receive chat.
- Join media.
- Moderate.
- Transition spaces.
- Access map/object metadata.

## 7. Desktop Boundary

Tauri 2 is a later packaging target, not a Phase 0 requirement.

Use it only after the browser MVP has stable:

- Authentication and session handling.
- World rendering and protocol client.
- Media policy flow.
- Asset loading and cache strategy.

The desktop wrapper must not introduce a second product runtime. It should wrap
the same web app and call the same backend APIs unless an explicit offline/local
feature is approved later.

## 8. Reference Notes

- Phaser 4 includes `TilemapGPULayer`, but it is WebGL-only, orthographic, and
  optimized for static single-tileset layers.
- LiveKit access tokens are JWT-based and must be generated on a backend.
- Tauri can produce small desktop apps because it uses the OS web renderer, but
  actual package size depends on platform and bundled dependencies.
