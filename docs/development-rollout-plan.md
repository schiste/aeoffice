# Development Rollout Plan

This document turns the product specification into an execution plan. It is the
operational companion to the global spec and Phase 0 hard-fork plan.

## 1. Rollout Principles

- Ship in narrow, verified slices with granular commits.
- Keep the browser app first. Desktop packaging, broadcast mode, and enterprise
  meeting integrations come later.
- Keep product logic TypeScript-first, while using best-fit infrastructure for
  persistence, media, cache, and asset storage.
- Treat the server as authoritative for identity, movement, permissions, chat,
  collisions, zones, media access, and map publication.
- Focus the next implementation phase on the customer app layer. Full role/RBAC
  management, role administration UI, and SaaS control-plane synchronization are
  deferred to later phases.
- Add AI map generation only after deterministic schemas, compilers, validators,
  persistence, and preview workflows exist without an LLM.
- Do not add product polish on top of legacy SkyOffice architecture.

## 2. Workstreams

  permissions.
- Access can be seeded or fixture-backed as long as server-side enforcement is
  preserved.

- Publish/rollback flow.
- MDI preview for hand-authored or imported drafts.

Exit gates:

- Admins can inspect and validate map drafts.
- Publishing requires permission and passes validation.

### Phase 6: AI Map Generation And Agent APIs

Goal:

Enable AI agents and prompt-to-map generation safely.

Scope:

- MDI schema.
- Asset dictionary exposure.
- Deterministic compiler.
- Validation reports.

- Generated maps are drafts until an authorized publish action.
- Clients cannot update authoritative collision, zones, permissions, or media
  policies.

### Phase 7: Enterprise Meeting Integrations

Goal:

Support tenants that already use Google Meet, Teams, or Zoom.

Scope:

- Provider settings.
- Meeting launch policies.
- Provider-specific permission mapping.
- Audit and token handling.

Exit gates:

- Integrations are tenant-configurable.
- Provider credentials are encrypted.
- LiveKit remains the default built-in media path.

### Phase 8: Broadcast And Large Rooms

Goal:

Support town halls and large events without making every viewer a full meeting
participant.

Scope:

- Presenter stage.
- Broadcast viewer mode.
- Moderated Q&A promotion.
- Temporary small-room interactions.
- Usage metering.

Exit gates:

- Viewers consume broadcast-style media efficiently.

### Phase 9: Commercial Asset Cleanup

Goal:

Prepare for public commercial/open-source launch.

Scope:

- Commercial-safe default tilesets.
- Commercial-safe avatars.
- Tenant asset library.
- License manifest enforcement.
- Public launch art pack.

Exit gates:

- Target app bundles only cleared assets.
- Asset dictionary includes license status.
- Uncleared legacy assets remain quarantined.

## 4. Release Process

Every feature slice should follow this order:

1. Update or add focused tests/fixtures.
2. Implement the smallest useful boundary.
3. Run `scripts/verify-target-stack.sh`.
4. Run `SKIP_INSTALL=1 scripts/verify-skyoffice-baseline.sh` when touching
   fork boundaries, build tooling, or shared assumptions.
5. Commit with a narrow message.
6. Keep unrelated refactors out of the slice.

Feature flags are required for:

- AI model calls.
- Tauri packaging.
- Broadcast mode.
- Enterprise meeting integrations.
- Any tenant-facing beta admin UI.

## 5. Promotion Rules

Local-only:

- Works with fixtures and in-memory adapters.
- No tenant data.
- No external provider credentials.

Internal preview:

- Uses Postgres/Valkey/LiveKit locally or in a dev environment.
- Has audit logs for high-risk actions.
- Is behind feature flags.

Tenant beta:

- Has RBAC enforcement.
- Has rollback for map changes.
- Has basic observability.
- Has documented limits.

Production:

- Has tenant isolation tests.
- Has backup/restore expectations.
- Has secret management.
- Has cost controls for media and AI usage.
- Has asset license checks.

## 6. Stop Conditions

Stop and reassess before continuing if:

- Client-side code becomes authoritative for movement, collision, permissions, or
  media access.
- AI output is used without schema validation.
- Map publishing can skip RBAC or validation.
- Legacy SkyOffice code becomes the production architecture again.
- A feature requires production asset licensing decisions before the planned
  asset cleanup phase.
