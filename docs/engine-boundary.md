# Domain-Neutral Game Engine Boundary Audit

## Purpose

This document defines the current boundary between the reusable 2D game
foundation and the virtual-office product code. The goal is to extract a
domain-neutral engine cleanly enough that the existing virtual office and a
future RPG/strategy/idle app can live in the same repo while sharing the same
map, asset, renderer, input, protocol, and simulation primitives.

This is a boundary audit only. No code movement is part of this phase.

## Boundary Rule

Neutral engine packages may know about:

- entities, players, units, positions, vectors, directions, ticks, and snapshots
- maps, tiles, layers, zones, spawns, blocked tiles, collision, and path/occupancy
- assets, atlases, frame metadata, footprints, anchors, occlusion, variants, and
  generic interaction affordances
- renderer hosts, scenes, cameras, labels, z-ordering, effects, telemetry, and QA
- input intents such as move, run, interact, select, cancel, and pointer/touch state

Neutral engine packages must not know about:

- meetings, media calls, office rooms, lobbies, lounges, tenant admin, RBAC, or
  Wikimedia auth
- RPG quests, combat, resource production, buildings, offline progression, or
  factions
- product-specific UI copy, product lifecycle messages, or app-specific controls

Domain packages translate neutral primitives into product behavior. For example,
an office package may map a zone action to "Join meeting", while an RPG package
may map the same primitive to "Harvest node" or "Enter building".

## Classification Legend

- `engine-neutral`: reusable foundation or near-reusable with small naming fixes
- `office-domain`: virtual-office domain data, maps, assets, prompts, or behavior
- `app-ui`: browser UI shell, product copy, DOM panels, and local demo workflow
- `server/product`: platform, auth, persistence, media, policy, and deployment

## Current Code Classification

| Path | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/map-engine` | `engine-neutral` | Strongest current engine package. It owns vector movement, collision, zone overlap, speed limits, and permission-gated zone entry. Keep it neutral, but eventually rename concepts around generic entity movement instead of player-only movement if strategy units share it. |
| `packages/protocol` | `engine-neutral` with social/product edges | Movement intents, snapshots, directions, run/walk, and reconciliation payloads are reusable. Chat scopes and animation naming are useful for the office but should move behind optional domain extensions before this becomes the shared protocol for RPG/idle. |
| `packages/shared-types` | `server/product` with reusable IDs | Branded IDs are useful, but `TenantId`, `SessionId`, roles, permissions, and token claims are platform concerns. A future `game-core` should define engine IDs separately from account/platform IDs. |
| `packages/asset-registry` | mixed: `engine-neutral` + `office-domain` | Contains the best next extraction target. Generic asset metadata, atlas source metadata, footprints, z-anchors, occlusion, variants, validation, and compiled map layer shapes are reusable. The starter catalog, office style tags, SkyOffice references, prompt compiler, presets, and office furniture IDs are domain data. |
| `packages/policy` | `server/product` | Chat/media policy is important for virtual office and may stay shared for collaboration apps, but it is not a neutral game engine concern. RPG/idle permissions should not depend on media/chat policy. |
| `packages/auth-wikimedia` | `server/product` | Platform auth provider integration. Keep outside engine. |
| `apps/world-server` | mixed: `engine-neutral` runtime + `server/product` room service | Uses neutral map/movement/protocol primitives but also owns room membership, permissions, chat handling, and HTTP/WebSocket runtime details. Extract simulation/tick logic later; leave room/product orchestration here for now. |
| `apps/api` | `server/product` | Identity, sessions, permissions, persistence, OAuth, and world metadata APIs. Keep outside engine. |
| `apps/media-gateway` | `server/product` | Media token and LiveKit-style policy. Office/collaboration domain, not engine. |
| `apps/web/src/browser/engine/input-controller.ts` | `engine-neutral` candidate | Keyboard/touch intent capture is reusable. Needs a package boundary and generic app bindings. |
| `apps/web/src/browser/engine/world-sync-controller.ts` | `engine-neutral` candidate | Thin realtime protocol wrapper. Good candidate for `game-protocol` or `game-sync` after the protocol boundary is cleaned up. |
| `apps/web/src/browser/client-motion-controller.ts` and `movement-*` | `engine-neutral` candidate | Client prediction, smoothing, and movement feel are reusable for local/remote entities. Need generic entity naming and package-level tests before extraction. |
| `apps/web/src/browser/renderer/*` | mixed: mostly `engine-neutral` with office leaks | Tilemap, object, avatar/entity, zone, camera, DOM label, effects, telemetry, input, physics affordance, and QA support are reusable. `office-scene.ts`, `phaser-office-renderer.ts`, scene keys, meeting/media/audio naming, tenant lighting names, and zone action types are office/product leaks. |
| `apps/web/src/browser/main.ts` | `app-ui` with extraction candidates | Product shell, state, panels, prompt-to-map flow, media controls, chat, lifecycle copy, and `render_game_to_text`. Some helpers can move later, but this file should remain the office app adapter after extraction. |
| `apps/web/src/browser/styles.css` and `apps/web/index.html` | `app-ui` | Office product surface and layout. A future RPG app should not inherit these directly. |
| `apps/web/public/assets/internal-office-*` | `office-domain` | Office-specific generated atlas/manifest. The manifest schema is reusable; the files and source catalog belong to office-domain until a generic asset bundle layer exists. |
| `scripts/build-internal-office-atlas.cjs` | `office-domain` with reusable pattern | The generation/validation pattern is useful, but this script emits office assets and hard-codes office frames. A future engine should expose atlas manifest validation; each domain should own its atlas build script. |
| `scripts/frontend-smoke.test.cjs` | `app-ui` QA | Office demo smoke. Keep, but split multi-app smoke later. |
| `scripts/renderer-qa.test.cjs` | mixed: `engine-neutral` QA + office fixtures | Renderer nonblank, camera, depth, avatar, labels, and telemetry checks are reusable. Current fixtures and labels use office maps, office zones, and office UI state. |
| `scripts/responsive-layout-qa.test.cjs` | `app-ui` QA | Office product layout QA. Future apps need their own responsive smoke or a shared helper. |
| `docs/*` | mostly `office-domain`/planning | Current docs are centered on the virtual-office product. This document starts the shared-engine planning track. |

## Current Leaks To Fix Before Extraction

### Asset Registry

`packages/asset-registry/src/index.ts` currently combines four different
concerns:

- neutral asset types and validation
- neutral compiled map layer shapes
- office asset catalog data
- office prompt/preset generation

Specific leaks:

- `VisualAssetThemeTag` includes office tags such as `neutral_office`,
  `meeting`, `lounge`, `kitchen`, and `entry`.
- `starterVisualAssetCatalog` bundles office furniture, office walls, office
  styles, and legacy SkyOffice reference metadata.
- atlas constants contain `internal.generated.office.polished_v1`,
  `tileset.internal.polished.office`, and `internal-office-atlas`.
- `PresetMapId` is `lobby | meeting_room | lounge_cafe`.
- `SemanticZoneDefinition.zoneType` is limited to `meeting_private | lobby | quiet`.
- `promptToSemanticMapDefinition` is an office meeting-room generator, not a
  generic map generator.

Target split:

- `packages/game-assets`: metadata interfaces, manifest schema, validation,
  source/license helpers, footprints, occlusion, variants, interaction
  affordances.
- `packages/game-map`: semantic map schema, compiled layer schema, map
  validation, collision layer creation, spawn validation.
- `packages/office-domain`: office catalog, office prompt compiler, office
  presets, SkyOffice reference metadata, and internal office atlas paths.

### Map Compiler

`compileSemanticMapDefinition` is close to reusable, but the surrounding schema
is office-shaped.

Specific leaks:

- `SemanticMapDefinition.roomDimensions` assumes room-like rectangular maps.
  This is fine for office rooms but too narrow for RPG regions, idle towns, and
  strategy maps.
- furniture placements use `item` names that are converted to `item.${name}`.
  A neutral compiler should accept explicit token IDs or a domain resolver.
- zone types are office-only.
- prompt compilation is mixed into the same module as deterministic compilation.

Target split:

- Neutral compiler accepts token IDs, map dimensions, layers, zones, and domain
  metadata.
- Office compiler maps user prompts like "cozy meeting room" into the neutral
  schema.
- RPG compiler can map "starter forest camp" into the same neutral schema
  without importing office assets.

### Renderer Types

`apps/web/src/browser/renderer/types.ts` is mostly reusable, but it contains
domain words that would make a second app inherit office assumptions.

Specific leaks:

- `RendererZoneKind` includes `meeting`, `private`, `portal`, `lobby`, and
  `quiet`.
- `RendererZoneAction` includes `join_meeting`, `enter_private`, and
  `enter_portal`.
- `RendererAudioInfo` explicitly says media is handled by
  `livekit_or_browser_media`.
- `RendererEffectsInfo` includes tenant lighting terminology.
- `RendererSceneManagerInfo` reports `boot_preload_office_runtime` and
  `OfficeScene`.
- `FixtureToken.asset` imports `VisualAssetFrameMetadata` from
  `@aedventure/asset-registry`, which will be wrong once asset metadata moves to
  `game-assets`.

Target split:

- `packages/game-renderer-phaser`: generic renderer types, scene names,
  telemetry, camera, labels, effects, input hit testing, and depth info.
- `packages/office-domain`: office zone kind/action mapping and office-specific
  presentation labels.
- Optional domain extension type parameters or adapter callbacks for zone action
  labels and interaction priorities.

### Interaction Candidates

World interaction candidate construction currently lives in
`apps/web/src/browser/main.ts`, which means product state and engine state are
interleaved.

Specific leaks:

- `worldInteractionCandidateForZone` uses office zone actions.
- `worldInteractionSignature` includes `meetingJoined`.
- candidate priorities rank `join_meeting` above other actions.
- UI permission state is tied to server-permitted office actions.
- object affordances are generic enough to reuse, but their labels/prompts are
  currently mixed with office UI behavior.

Target split:

- Neutral interaction candidate builder:
  - zone candidate from bounds and action metadata
  - object candidate from asset interaction metadata
  - distance, active state, marker visibility, and priority hooks
- Domain resolver:
  - office maps `meeting_private` to `join_meeting`
  - RPG maps `resource_node` to `gather`, `building` to `upgrade`, etc.
- App adapter:
  - decides whether a candidate is server-permitted and how to display it.

### `render_game_to_text`

`render_game_to_text` is valuable for automation and agent friendliness, but the
current payload is an office app payload rather than a neutral engine snapshot.

Specific leaks:

- top-level fields include `sessionStatus`, `worldStatus`, `mediaStatus`,
  office controls, lifecycle copy, room empty state, and office collaboration
  panels.
- renderer telemetry is reusable, but mixed into a product status payload.
- movement and player fields are reusable if renamed around entities/local
  controlled actor.
- meeting, media, chat, room, and prompt-to-map data are office app concerns.

Target split:

- Neutral engine telemetry:
  - map, camera, renderer, input, entities, local actor, zones, interactions,
    movement/reconciliation, performance, and capabilities.
- App telemetry:
  - office session/media/chat/lifecycle panels.
- A future RPG app can expose the same neutral engine payload plus RPG-specific
  resource/building/progression sections.

## Extraction Order

### First Move: `game-assets`

Move only neutral asset definitions and validation first. This is lowest risk
because the data model is already strongly typed and well tested.

Move:

- `VisualAssetSource`, `TilesetDefinition`, `VisualAssetFrameMetadata`
- footprints, anchors, occlusion, variants, interaction metadata
- catalog validation helpers
- manifest schema alignment used by `verify-internal-assets`

Leave in office domain:

- starter office catalog
- office source IDs and atlas paths
- SkyOffice reference source metadata
- office token IDs and tags
- office atlas generator frames

### Second Move: `game-map`

Move compiled map primitives and validation once asset metadata has a neutral
home.

Move:

- tile layer interfaces
- compiled map interfaces
- collision layer generation
- blocked tile/spawn/zone validation
- `compileSemanticMapDefinition` after replacing implicit `item.${name}` lookup
  with a token resolver

Leave in office domain:

- prompt keyword extraction
- office prompt-to-map compiler
- lobby/meeting/lounge presets
- office zone type mapping

### Third Move: `game-renderer-phaser`

Extract renderer modules after the map/asset contracts are neutral.

Move:

- renderer host
- scene manager with generic scene keys
- tilemap/object/avatar/entity/zone/camera renderers
- DOM label overlays
- input hit testing
- renderer telemetry
- renderer QA helpers

Leave in office app/domain:

- office zone labels/actions
- meeting/media UI wiring
- office scene adapter state
- office prompt-to-map controls

### Fourth Move: `game-input` and `game-protocol`

Extract after the renderer can consume neutral maps/entities.

Move:

- keyboard/touch vector input
- run/walk intent generation
- sequence-numbered input history shape
- movement snapshots and reconciliation payloads
- generic action command shape

Leave in office app/server:

- room chat/media messages until optional domain protocol extensions exist
- OAuth/session/permission token claims

### Fifth Move: Tiny RPG/Idle Demo

Add a minimal second app only after the first three packages exist.

Acceptance for the demo:

- imports `game-assets`, `game-map`, `game-renderer-phaser`, and `game-input`
- does not import `office-domain`
- renders one map, one local actor/unit, one resource/object, and one zone
- exposes neutral `render_game_to_text` fields plus a small RPG-specific section

## Package Target Shape

```txt
apps/
  virtual-office/
  engine-sandbox/
  add-rpg/

packages/
  game-assets/
  game-map/
  game-renderer-phaser/
  game-input/
  game-protocol/
  game-core/
  game-telemetry/

  office-domain/
  add-domain/
```

The existing `apps/web` can stay in place during extraction, but its long-term
role should become the virtual-office app adapter. Renaming it to
`apps/virtual-office` is useful later, not in the first extraction commit.

## Acceptance Gates For Each Extraction Phase

Every extraction phase must keep:

- virtual office behavior unchanged
- no office imports from neutral packages
- no RPG imports from neutral packages
- no direct UI or server imports inside engine packages
- `npm run check` passing
- `npm run smoke:frontend` passing until multi-app smoke exists
- `npm run qa:renderer` passing
- `npm run qa:responsive` passing
- `git diff --check` clean

After the placeholder RPG/idle demo is retired, keep:

- ADD smoke test as the real RPG/idle app check
- engine sandbox square/hex nonblank screenshot check
- import boundary checks for `office-domain`, `add-domain`, and neutral engine
  packages

## Immediate Next Implementation Task

Implement Phase 2 by extracting `packages/game-assets`:

1. Create the package with neutral asset metadata and validation helpers.
2. Update `packages/asset-registry` to import those neutral types.
3. Keep all office catalog data in the current package for the first extraction
   commit.
4. Add tests proving the office catalog still validates against the neutral
   asset model.
5. Do not change rendered output.

This first move gives the repo a real shared-engine package while keeping risk
low and preserving the current virtual-office demo.
