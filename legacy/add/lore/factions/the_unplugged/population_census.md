## Overview

This document defines the statistical model for generating the full Unplugged population (~2,000 people, ~149 families). The model uses weighted distributions to procedurally generate individuals while maintaining lore consistency.

**Design Goals:**
- Generate coherent, lore-consistent characters procedurally
- Support both random crew generation and authored story characters
- Every generated character feels like they belong to this world
- Statistics reflect 300 years of underground cave society evolution

---

## 1) Population Demographics

### 1.1 Total Population
- **Year 300 AS:** ~2,000 people
- **Families:** ~149 (average ~13.4 per family, dynasty consolidation)
- **Original families:** 102 (Year 1 AS)

### 1.2 Age Distribution

Cave society with controlled growth, high child survival, moderate lifespan.

| Age Range | % of Pop | Count | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------|
| 0-7 (Children) | 12% | ~240 | Pre-Selection Day |
| 8-15 (Apprentices) | 10% | ~200 | Post-Selection, in training |
| 16-25 (Young Adults) | 18% | ~360 | Coming of Age to established |
| 26-40 (Adults) | 25% | ~500 | Prime working years |
| 41-55 (Middle Age) | 20% | ~400 | Experienced, often leaders |
| 56-70 (Elders) | 12% | ~240 | Respected, advisory roles |
| 71+ (Venerable) | 3% | ~60 | Rare, celebrated |

**Recruitable Pool:** Ages 16-55 most likely (~1,260 people theoretically available)

### 1.3 Gender Distribution
- **50/50 split** (cave society has no survival pressure favoring either)
- Names and roles are not gender-locked

---

## 2) Family Distribution

### 2.1 Family Size Categories

After 300 years of underground dynasties with limited space and controlled growth, families have consolidated. The original 102 families merged, branched, and absorbed smaller lines. Many "families" are now extended clans spanning 10-12 generations.

| Category | % of Families | Members | Family Count | Total People |
|----------|---------------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Small (recent splits, dying lines) | 15% | 5-10 | ~22 | ~165 |
| Medium | 30% | 11-20 | ~45 | ~700 |
| Large | 35% | 21-40 | ~52 | ~1,560 |
| Dynasty (founding families) | 20% | 41-80 | ~30 | ~1,575 |

**Total:** ~149 family names, ~2,000 people
**Average family size:** ~13.4 members

**Notes:**
- Original 102 families consolidated to ~80 lines through marriage and mergers
- ~70 new family names emerged (splits, adopted names, compound names)
- Founding families tend toward Dynasty size (300 years of prestige = more marriages)
- Small families are often recent branches or lines with poor survival/fertility

## 3) Physical Traits

### 3.1 Height Distribution

300 years underground with limited nutrition, vitamin D deficiency, and cramped spaces has significantly reduced average height. The Unplugged are notably shorter than pre-Silence populations.

| Category | Male Range | Female Range | % of Pop |
|----------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Very Short | 145-155cm | 140-150cm | 20% |
| Short | 155-163cm | 150-158cm | 35% |
| Average | 163-170cm | 158-165cm | 30% |
| Tall | 170-178cm | 165-172cm | 12% |
| Very Tall | 178-185cm | 172-180cm | 3% |

**Population Averages:**
- Male average: ~161cm (vs ~175cm pre-Silence French)
- Female average: ~156cm (vs ~163cm pre-Silence French)

**Family Modifiers:**
- Lindquist: +5% Tall (Scandinavian heritage, somewhat preserved)
- Lefebvre: +3% Tall (digger selection favors stockier builds)
- Bouche: -3% height (lung capacity prioritized over height)
- Vidal: +2% Average (farmers eat better)

**Cave Dweller Adaptations:**
- Shorter limbs, more compact builds (thermal efficiency)
- Larger eyes relative to face (low light adaptation)
- Paler skin (no sun exposure)
- Denser bones in some families (climbing/tunnel work)

### 3.2 Build Distribution

| Build | % of Pop | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Slight | 15% | Light frame, quick |
| Lean | 30% | Wiry, efficient |
| Average | 30% | Balanced |
| Sturdy | 18% | Solid, strong |
| Heavyset | 7% | Rare in cave diet |

**Profession Modifiers:**
- Digger: +20% Sturdy
- Guard: +15% Sturdy
- Farmer: +10% Lean
- Teacher: +10% Slight/Average

### 3.3 Hair Color

300 years of French cave population with some outside genetics (Lindquist Scandinavian, Brenner German).

| Color | % of Pop | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Black | 15% | |
| Dark Brown | 35% | Most common |
| Medium Brown | 25% | |
| Light Brown | 12% | |
| Auburn/Red | 5% | |
| Blonde | 6% | Higher in Lindquist, Brenner |
| Grey/White | 2% | Age-related, any base |

**Family Modifiers:**
- Lindquist: +15% Blonde, +5% Light Brown
- Brenner: +10% Blonde
- Delacroix: +5% Black (Mediterranean heritage)

### 3.4 Eye Color

300 years of limited gene pool has homogenized eye color significantly. Brown dominates as the dominant allele has spread through the population.

| Color | % of Pop | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Brown | 65% | Dominant gene, majority population |
| Dark Brown | 15% | Near-black, common |
| Hazel | 10% | Brown-green mix, declining |
| Green | 5% | Recessive, rare |
| Blue | 4% | Recessive, concentrated in specific families |
| Grey | 1% | Very rare |

**Family Modifiers:**
- Lindquist: +15% Blue (Scandinavian genetics, preserved through isolation)
- Brenner: +10% Blue (German heritage)
- Most other families: 80%+ brown-eyed

**Genetic Note:**
Blue and green eyes are considered "exotic" in Year 300 AS. A blue-eyed person draws attention. Some families specifically seek blue-eyed marriage partners to preserve the trait - particularly Lindquists, who view it as connection to their Scandinavian heritage.

### 3.5 Skin Tone

300 years underground = very limited sun exposure. Population is notably pale regardless of heritage.

| Tone | % of Pop | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Very Pale | 40% | Cave-dweller standard |
| Pale | 35% | Slight warmth |
| Fair | 15% | Some melanin heritage visible |
| Medium | 8% | Darker heritage, still paled |
| Warm | 2% | Recent surface exposure (Lindquists) |

**Modifiers:**

### 4.4 The Sounding Five Descendants (Hidden Non-Believers)

A specific subgroup carries a secret hatred of music passed down through generations. The descendants of the Sounding Five - the original conspiracy that caused The Silence - have never forgotten. They don't know the full truth of what their ancestors did, but they inherited:

- **A bone-deep resentment of music** ("Music destroyed everything")
- **Suppressed guilt they can't explain** (genetic memory of crime)
- **Hostility toward vinyl creeds** (seeing worship as obscene)

**Population:** ~150 people (~7.5% of population)
**Distribution:** Concentrated in 5-8 family lines (names obscured over time)
**Creed:** Officially Skeptic (60%) or Nominal in other creeds (40%)
**Politics:** Tend toward Earthbound (25%) or Traditionalist (35%)

**Behavior:**
- Never volunteer for sound-related duties
- Avoid the Vinyl Guardian's presence
- Express discomfort during Mandatory Arts (excuses, minimal participation)
- Marry within their hidden community when possible
- Pass down the resentment without explaining why

**Story Hook:** Some of these descendants may have fragments of forbidden knowledge - partial truths about what really happened. A player who recruits one may trigger special events.

**Trait Connection:** The "Knows Too Much" legendary trait may appear in Sounding Five descendants who pieced together the family secret.

### 8.2 Nicknames (Ententernickname)

The Unplugged nickname tradition evolved directly from the original Telegram handles (@UndergroundDad, @SporeMom, etc.). Over 300 years, this became the defining naming convention - everyone has an @ handle, even though there's no more internet.

**FORMAT:** All nicknames use @ prefix, written as **@Handle**

**RULES:**
- Given at birth or shortly after by parents
- Used more than legal names in daily conversation
- Written on all official documents after legal name
- The worse the pun, the higher the prestige
- Parents compete for the most groan-worthy handles
- Multi-generational puns are especially valued

**Lindquist Exception:** @FirstName only (per lore - Kaylee never had a handle, tradition stuck)

## 9) Generation Algorithm

### 9.1 Individual Generation Steps

```
1. DETERMINE FAMILY
   - Roll against family distribution (Section 2.2)
   - If minor family, generate or pull from minor family pool

2. DETERMINE DEMOGRAPHICS
   - Age: Roll against age distribution (2.1)
   - Gender: 50/50

3. GENERATE PHYSICAL TRAITS
   - Height: Roll base + family modifier (3.1)
   - Build: Roll base + profession modifier (3.2)
   - Hair: Roll base + family modifier (3.3)
   - Eyes: Roll base + family modifier (3.4)
   - Skin: Roll base + surface exposure modifier (3.5)
   - Features: Roll 0-3 distinguishing features (3.6)

4. DETERMINE BELIEFS
   - Creed: Roll against family creed distribution (4.2)
   - Creed intensity: Roll against intensity distribution (4.3)
   - Politics: Roll against family politics distribution (5.2)
   - Studio Echo stance: Roll with modifiers (5.3)

5. DETERMINE PROFESSION
   - If age >= 8: Roll profession with family affinity (6.1, 6.2)
   - If age < 8: No profession yet

6. GENERATE NAME
   - First name: Roll from appropriate pool (8.1)
   - Nickname: Generate based on category roll (8.2)
   - Family name: From family assignment

7. GENERATE TRAITS (if recruitable)
   - Positive: Roll rarity, then trait from available pool
   - Negative: Roll rarity, then trait from available pool
   - Mixed: Roll rarity, then trait from available pool
   - Apply family/creed weights
   - Check opposition rules

8. GENERATE RELATIONSHIPS (optional depth)
   - Parents (if not orphan)
   - Siblings (based on family size)
   - Spouse (if age-appropriate, ~60% of 25+ are married)
   - Children (if married and age-appropriate)

9. APPLY STORY FLAGS (for special characters)
   - Recruitable: Yes/No
   - Story role: None/Minor/Major/Key
   - Unlock condition: None/Story/Quest/Achievement
```

### 9.2 Batch Generation

For full census:
1. Generate all ~149 family units first
2. Assign members to families based on family size distribution
3. Generate individuals within family context
4. Build relationship graphs
5. Flag ~100-200 for "notable" status (named in story)
6. Flag ~50-100 for "recruitable with conditions"

---

## 10) Authored Characters (Story Layer)

These characters are hand-written, not generated. They override procedural generation.

### 10.1 Key Story Characters

*To be authored separately - these have fixed traits, relationships, and story roles.*

**Examples of needed authored characters:**
- The current Dadi (Sylvain Marchand) - already in lore
- The Hero's immediate family (Lindquist)
- Key political figures from each major family
- The Vinyl Guardian (current)
- Notable Martinets (investigators)
- Jérôme "Beatbox" Bouche's descendants
- Old Sweep Maurice (if still alive?)
- First recruits (true believers)

### 10.2 Special Recruit Pool

Characters who can only be recruited under specific conditions:

| Character Type | Unlock Condition | Example |
|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Political Delegate | Reach certain reputation | Delacroix sends observer |
| Specialist | Complete related quest | Master engineer |
| Reluctant Hero | Prove Studio Echo viable | Earthbound convert |
| Family Black Sheep | Secret discovered | Marchand with drive knowledge |
| Prodigy | Random rare event | Young genius |

### 11.2 Census Statistics Validation

After generation, validate:
- Family size distribution matches targets
- Age distribution matches targets
- Creed distribution matches targets (overall and per-family)
- Politics distribution matches targets
- Profession distribution matches targets
- Trait rarity distribution is correct
- No impossible trait combinations exist

## 12) Open Questions

- [ ] How many authored characters do we need for story?
- [ ] What's the minimum data needed for non-recruitable NPCs?
- [ ] Should relationships affect recruitment (e.g., "won't come if sibling was sent back")?
- [ ] How to handle character aging across Tunings (time passes)?
- [ ] Should some traits be generational (passed parent to child)?
