# aeoffice Import Note

This directory is historical source material imported from the ADD repository
for the planned `apps/add-rpg` migration. Do not develop the live ADD app in
`legacy/add/`; extract runtime, domain, renderer, and UI pieces into the target
`aeoffice` workspace packages described in `docs/add-migration-plan.md`.

Migration note: the ADD Rust runtime crates were moved into the aeoffice root
workspace under `crates/add-core`, `crates/add-web-bindings`, and
`crates/add-web-worker`.
