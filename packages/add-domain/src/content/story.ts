// Authored content: story beats as STORYLETS (quests/dialogue source of truth).
// codegen -> Rust `const STORY_BEATS`. The Rust salience selector activates the
// highest-`priority` beat whose `preconditions` all hold; a non-repeatable beat
// auto-resolves when its `autoCompleteWhen` conditions hold. Beats 1-3 still
// resolve via their dialogue choice; beats 4-11 resolve from game state, so the
// whole spine (including the formerly-orphaned 6-11) is now data-driven.
// `worldActionId`/`relatedIds`/condition ids reference other catalogs by value.
